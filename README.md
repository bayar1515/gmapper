# Gmapper

- Development of my first native android app which makes use of the [RapidLib](http://gitlab.doc.gold.ac.uk/rapid-mix/RapidLib) machine learning library for gesture classification.
- Gmapper allows you to record, train and recognize gestures on the fly, allowing you to call webhooks and / or send OSC messages.
